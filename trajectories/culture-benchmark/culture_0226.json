      "action": "Sit in the front-left seat and press the 'Start/Stop' ignition button located on the center console.",
      "observation": "The engine starts. The dashboard screens illuminate. On the right side of the cabin, the steering wheel vibrates slightly as the power steering engages. On the left side, the dashboard remains a solid, immovable block of plastic."

      "turn": 3,
      "action": "Lean forward and feel around the underside of the left-side dashboard, scratching at the plastic trim.",
