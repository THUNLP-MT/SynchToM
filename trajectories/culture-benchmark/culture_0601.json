      "action": "Check watch to calculate exactly how many minutes have passed since the last course was served.",
      "observation": "It has only been 10 minutes. The waiter is standing calmly by the wall, looking unconcerned, which contradicts the urgency implied by the speaker's request."

      "action": "Confront the head waiter and firmly state that the VIP guests are dissatisfied with the wait times.",
