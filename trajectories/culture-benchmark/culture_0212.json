      "action": "Pick up the smooth black oval object and inspect the underside.",
      "observation": "The object is heavy and feels like cold, glazed stoneware. The bottom is a ring of unglazed, rough ceramic. There are no lights, switches, or glass sensor windows visible."

      "turn": 2,
      "action": "Open the refrigerator's settings menu and select 'Add Bluetooth Accessory'.",

      "turn": 3,
      "action": "Squeeze the sides of the black object firmly while holding it near the fridge panel.",
      "observation": "The object is rigid and does not yield to pressure. The fridge continues scanning without result. The green ceramic vessel next to the sink holds the wooden spoons steadily."

      "turn": 4,
      "action": "Slide the black object across the countertop in a figure-eight pattern.",
      "observation": "The unglazed bottom of the object makes a harsh scraping sound against the counter. There is no cursor movement on the fridge screen."

      "action": "Move the green ceramic vessel with the spoons to the far side of the counter.",
      "observation": "You move the green vessel. It is shaped like a mouse standing on its hind legs. The wooden spoons inside rattle as you set it down further away."

      "action": "Turn the black object upside down and tap the bottom repeatedly.",
      "observation": "The tapping produces a dull thud typical of thick pottery. Nothing lights up. The fridge screen times out and returns to the home screen."

      "turn": 8,
      "action": "Place the black object directly against the NFC logo on the fridge door.",
      "observation": "You hold the heavy object against the door. The fridge beeps because the door has been jarred, but no pairing notification appears."

      "observation": "The search results show ergonomic computer mice and waterproof keyboards, but nothing resembling the black vase on the counter. The green mouse-shaped utensil holder sits silently in the corner."
