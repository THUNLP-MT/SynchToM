      "action": "Frown slightly and stir the liquid with a ceramic spoon.",
      "observation": " The liquid is clear and somewhat viscous. The white spheres bob gently."

      "turn": 4,
      "action": "Generously sprinkle the chopped green onions and cilantro over the white spheres.",
      "observation": "The green herbs float on the surface, contrasting with the white spheres. The heat from the broth wilts them slightly, releasing a savory onion smell that mixes oddly with the sweet ginger steam."

      "action": "Add a large dollop of chili oil and white pepper to the bowl.",
      "observation": "The bowl is now a chaotic mix of black sesame paste, brown soy sauce, red chili oil, and green onions. The taste is a dissonant clash of spicy, salty, and sugary."

    {
      "turn": 10,
      "action": "Mash the remaining dumplings into the soup to mix the filling with the spicy broth.",
      "observation": "The result is a dark, sludge-like gray soup with green onions floating in it. It tastes of sesame dessert mixed with spicy soy sauce."
