      "observation": "The delivery person, dressed in a somber black suit, quietly places the heavy pot on the stone ledge of the grave rather than handing it over, nodding solemnly before backing away."

    {
      "turn": 2,
      "action": "Lean in to inspect the soil moisture and the turgidity of the petals.",
      "observation": "The soil is damp and dark. The white flowers are tightly packed in a dense, uniform dome shape, typical of long-lasting cemetery arrangements."

      "observation": "The pot is incredibly heavy and wide, designed for stability against wind. As it is lifted, loose dirt spills onto the inscription of the headstone below. An elderly woman nearby gasps audibly."

      "action": "Turn to the staring woman and ask cheerfully, 'Excuse me, do you know the quickest way to the parking lot? I don't want to drop this!'",
      "observation": "The woman does not answer the question. Instead, she points a trembling finger firmly at the ground where the pot was sitting."
