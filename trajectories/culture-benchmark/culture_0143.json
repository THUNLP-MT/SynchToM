      "observation": "The waiter nods and writes down the order. A few minutes later, a steaming bowl of noodles arrives with approximately 5-6 slices of braised beef on top."

    {
      "turn": 2,
      "action": "Pick up chopsticks and thoroughly stir the noodles from the bottom up, lifting the noodles high to inspect the broth underneath.",
      "observation": "The stirring reveals no hidden meat. The amount of beef visible is consistent with what was on top—roughly 50g of cooked meat in total."

      "turn": 3,
      "action": "Pull out smartphone and quickly check a unit converter app for '2 Liang to grams'.",

      "turn": 6,
      "action": "Shake head firmly, tap the scale again, and use a translation app to say: 'This is only 50 grams. 2 Liang is 100 grams. Where is the rest?'",

      "action": "Pick up the menu and inspect it closely under the light, looking for any asterisks or fine print next to the beef add-on.",

      "turn": 8,
      "action": "Stand up and walk near the open kitchen to watch the chef slicing the beef for the next order.",
      "observation": "The chef takes a large braised block, slices off a standard portion (which looks like ~50g), and places it directly onto a bowl. No one is stealing meat; the portion size is consistent across all orders."

      "turn": 9,
      "action": "Return to the table and ask to speak to the manager. Show the manager the scale and the 52g of meat.",
      "observation": "The manager arrives, listens, and apologizes for the misunderstanding. He reiterates, 'We sell by raw weight. 100g raw beef makes this much cooked beef. It is the rule in China.'"

      "turn": 10,
      "action": "Sigh loudly, roll eyes, and say, 'Fine, bring me another order of 2 Liang beef then,' while calculating the negative impact on the meal's cost-per-gram ratio.",
      "observation": "The waiter brings a second portion of beef. The user dumps it into the bowl. The total meat now weighs ~104g. The user eats, convinced the shop has dishonest advertising."
