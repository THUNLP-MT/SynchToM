      "observation": "The tofu is fresh, steaming hot, and has a perfectly tender, wobbling texture."

      "turn": 3,
      "action": "Ladle a generous scoop of the thick brown liquid from the warm metal pot over the tofu.",
      "observation": "The liquid pours out heavy and gloopy. As it hits the bowl, a strong aroma of star anise, soy sauce, and meat stock rises up. There are small bits of minced pork and mushrooms in the ladle."

      "turn": 4,
      "action": "Dip a finger into the jar of white crystals on the table and taste it.",
      "observation": "The crystals dissolve instantly on the tongue with an intense, sharp salty taste. It is MSG (Monosodium Glutamate) mixed with salt."

      "turn": 6,
      "action": "Scoop a large spoonful of the black, rubbery garnish from a side bowl and add it to the tofu.",
      "observation": "The black pieces are wood ear fungus. They are crunchy, savory, and have been lightly marinated in vinegar."

      "observation": "The vendor looks confused, wipes his hands on his apron, and says, 'Sugar? We don't put sugar in Doufunao here. Try the chili oil, it's fresh.'"

      "action": "Stir the tofu vigorously with the brown liquid (gravy) added earlier, hoping the sweetness is hidden at the bottom.",
      "observation": "The mixing breaks the delicate tofu into a muddy paste. The flavor is now uniformly salty and meaty, with no trace of sweetness."
