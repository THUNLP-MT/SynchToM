      "observation": "The friend replies after a long pause: 'Yeah, it was definitely... distinct! I've never seen it served with whole hard-boiled eggs before. Very interesting texture.'"

      "action": "Reply to the friend: 'Exactly! The texture is key. I felt that scrambling the eggs hides their natural beauty. Did you prefer the pop of the whole cherry tomatoes or the density of the whole egg?'",
      "observation": "Friend responds: 'The tomatoes were very juicy since they were raw inside. The sauce was good though! Maybe next time we can try the style where the sauce gets *inside* the eggs?'"

      "turn": 3,
      "action": "Walk to the kitchen and taste the leftover sauce from the pan to check the seasoning balance.",
      "observation": "The sauce is a standard ketchup, sugar, and soy sauce glaze. It is thick and sits on top of the ingredients without integrating, as there are no crevices in hard-boiled eggs or skin-on tomatoes to catch it."

    {
      "turn": 5,
      "action": "Watch the video sent by the friend, focusing specifically on the visual presentation compared to my dish.",
      "observation": "The video shows the cook smashing the tomatoes to release juices that mix with fluffy scrambled eggs, creating a cohesive, orange-red gravy that coats everything uniformly."

      "turn": 6,
      "action": "Inspect the brand of cherry tomatoes used from the packaging in the trash.",
      "observation": "The packaging confirms they are 'Sweet 100s' cherry tomatoes, which have very thick skins that do not break down easily when cooked whole."

      "observation": "Friend responds: 'Haha, well, the soupy part is actually the best part over rice! But hey, thanks for cooking. Maybe next time I can come over early and help prep?'"

      "action": "Search online for 'how to serve sauce with hard-boiled eggs for better adherence'.",
      "observation": "Search results suggest 'scoring' the egg whites or making 'Tiger Skin Eggs' (frying the boiled eggs to blister the skin), neither of which are the traditional stir-fry method, but they address the 'adherence' issue."
