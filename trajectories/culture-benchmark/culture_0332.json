    {
      "turn": 2,
      "action": "Walk over to the camel and perform a quick physical inspection, checking its eyes, teeth, and general alertness.",
      "observation": "The camel is in excellent health, though a bit dusty. The elder ignores the inspection completely and begins sharpening a long, curved knife while looking admiringly at the horse."

    {
      "turn": 3,
      "action": "Retrieve the saddle and bridle from the pile of gear and attempt to place the saddle on the horse.",
      "observation": "The elder gently intercepts, taking the saddle away with a chuckle. He then slaps the horse's flank, pinching the layer of fat there and grunting with culinary appreciation."

    {
      "turn": 6,
      "action": "Take off my expensive wristwatch and offer it to the elder, while pointing at the horse and making a protective 'stop' gesture.",
      "observation": "The elder looks confused and slightly offended. He pushes the watch back, then hands me a heavy basin, gesturing for me to stand near the horse's head to catch the blood."

      "turn": 7,
      "action": "Drop the basin and aggressively point at the camel's hump, then rub my stomach and give a 'thumbs up' sign.",
      "observation": "The gathered guests murmur and laugh. The elder mimics a milking motion and points to the camel, then points to the horse, mimics chewing, and rolls his eyes back in ecstasy."

    {
      "turn": 10,
      "action": "Attempt to untie the horse's tether to lead it away 'to safety' behind the tent.",
      "observation": "Two young men step in and firmly restrain me, laughing good-naturedly as if I am playing a strange game, while the elder steps forward and swiftly performs the ceremonial blessing over the horse."
