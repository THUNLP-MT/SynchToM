      "observation": "The companion replies that it is the main banking district, though there are many restaurants to service the workers."

      "turn": 2,
      "action": "I look up at the overcast sky and button my coat, then remark, 'It is quite gray today. Do you find seafood to be a lighter, healthier option when the weather is heavy like this?'",

      "turn": 6,
      "action": "I check the date on my watch and ask, 'Forgive my ignorance of local customs, but does today mark any specific festival or calendar event in this region?'",
