      "turn": 1,
      "action": "Query the microscopy database for 'resolution limits by year' and 'magnification power timeline'.",
      "observation": "The database returns a list of scientists (Hooke, Schwann, Schleiden, Virchow) and their published arguments, with only minor metadata about the specific instruments used."
    },
    {
      "turn": 2,
      "action": "Open the protein modeling kit inventory to check for GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) models.",
      "observation": "The kit contains physical plastic models of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, along with a booklet on the historical discovery of protein structures."
    },
    {
      "turn": 3,
      "action": "Create a draft timeline titled 'The Evolution of Vision' placing the microscope models (Janssen, Hooke, Modern) as the primary nodes.",
      "observation": "The curriculum software flags the timeline with a warning: 'Content Gap: Missing core tenets of Cell Theory (All living things are cells, basic unit of life, cells from pre-existing cells).'"
    },
    {
      "turn": 4,
      "action": "Edit the timeline nodes to include text: 'Cell Theory became possible because this microscope achieved 30x magnification.'",
      "observation": "The software accepts the text but suggests a discussion prompt: 'How did collaboration and debate between scientists refine these theories?'"
    },
    {
      "turn": 5,
      "action": "Search the historical archives for the funding sources and costs of the Royal Society's equipment in the 1600s.",
      "observation": "The search results return letters between scientists debating the validity of observations, the philosophy of 'mechanism,' and the reliability of human senses."
    },
    {
      "turn": 6,
      "action": "Create a handout focusing on 'Diagnostic Capability' that equates 'Scientific Debate' with 'Verifying Instrument Calibration'.",
      "observation": "Student feedback from the pilot session: 'We know how to focus the microscope, but we don't understand why Virchow disagreed with Schwann about where cells come from.'"

      "turn": 7,
      "action": "Change the font of the timeline to a sans-serif, modern font and increase the resolution of the microscope images.",
      "observation": "The visual appeal is improved, but the learning objective checkbox 'Nature of Science: Subjectivity and Theory Change' remains unchecked."

    {
      "turn": 8,
      "action": "Write a lecture script explaining that Virchow's disagreement was solved because he had a better microscope than Schwann.",
      "observation": "The department head reviews the script and notes: 'This ignores the paradigm shift regarding spontaneous generation. It wasn't just better glass; it was a change in thinking and experimental design.'"
    },
    {
      "turn": 9,
      "action": "Add a section to the lesson on 'The Myth of Spontaneous Generation' arguing that it was a belief held due to low-resolution optical tools.",
      "observation": "The curriculum guide highlights that Pasteur used a simple swan-neck flask (low tech) to disprove the theory, not a high-power microscope."

    {
      "turn": 10,
      "action": "Design the final assessment to be a 'Microscope Matching Game' where students link biological discoveries to the specific lens curvature and numerical aperture used.",
      "observation": "The assessment is rejected by the curriculum coordinator for failing to measure the student's ability to evaluate scientific arguments or understand the epistemological nature of science."
