      "observation": "Students dutifully copy the steps into their notebooks. When asked to look at their previous answer (85m) versus the answer at t=5s (100m), they stare blankly, waiting for the teacher to tell them which step of the new list they missed."

      "observation": "Most students calculate position at t=8s correctly but fail to check for the turning point at t=5s. They provide the displacement value again. A few students ask, 'Do we use the formula on the board for this one too?'"

      "observation": "Students recognize the math. One says, 'Oh, it's -b/2a.' They can find the vertex time, but they treat it as an isolated math trivia question and do not connect it to the physical impossibility of their distance decreasing in the previous problem."
