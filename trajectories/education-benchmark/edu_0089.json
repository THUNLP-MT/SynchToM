      "turn": 1,
      "action": "Assign a worksheet requiring students to write the full alphanumeric electron configurations (e.g., 1s²2s²2p³) for Nitrogen and Oxygen.",
      "observation": "Most students correctly write '1s²2s²2p³' for Nitrogen, but when asked verbally how many unpaired electrons exist, 50% of the class answers '1' instead of '3'."
    },
    {
      "turn": 2,
      "action": "Review the students' previous math grades to check for arithmetic deficiencies.",
      "observation": "The students have excellent arithmetic skills and can easily sum the superscripts to find the total atomic number."
    },
    {
      "turn": 3,
      "action": "Deliver a lecture emphasizing the memorization of the Aufbau sequence (1s, then 2s, then 2p) and require students to recite the final string notation aloud.",
      "observation": "Students can chant the sequence perfectly. However, when a student asks, 'But how do the three electrons fit in the p-subshell?', I direct them back to the superscript '3' as the definitive answer."
    },
    {
      "turn": 4,
      "action": "Create a quiz where the primary question asks students to 'Write the electron configuration for Oxygen to demonstrate spin pairing.'",
      "observation": "Students write '1s²2s²2p⁴' correctly. However, on scratch paper, several students draw the p-orbital as one box with four electrons crammed in it, rather than three boxes."
    },
    {
      "turn": 5,
      "action": "Change the classroom seating arrangement to separate talkative students.",
      "observation": "The classroom is quieter, but the conceptual questions regarding paramagnetism (which relies on unpaired spins) are still being answered incorrectly."
    },
    {
      "turn": 6,
      "action": "Mark the scratch paper diagrams as 'irrelevant' and deduct points for using 'visual crutches' instead of the alphanumeric notation.",
      "observation": "Students stop drawing boxes. They write the strings correctly but look visibly confused when asked to predict if an atom is magnetic."
    },
    {
      "turn": 7,
      "action": "Investigate if the textbook has a typo in the chapter regarding Nitrogen's atomic number.",
      "observation": "The textbook is accurate and actually features a large section on orbital diagrams to explain Hund's Rule, which the educator glosses over."
    },
    {
      "turn": 8,
      "action": "Assign 50 practice problems where students must write the full alphanumeric configuration for various elements, banning any use of orbital box diagrams.",
      "observation": "Students complete the homework with 100% accuracy on the strings. However, a student asks, 'I know it's 2p3, but are the spins up or down?'"
    },
    {
      "turn": 9,
      "action": "Respond to the student by writing '2p³' in bold letters on the board and circling the '3'.",
      "observation": "The student nods slowly but whispers to a neighbor, 'I'll just memorize the number, I still don't get the spin part.'"
    },
    {
      "turn": 10,
      "action": "Final Summative Assessment: A single question asking for the 'Global Alphanumeric Configuration of Nitrogen' to prove adherence to Hund's Rule.",
      "observation": "Every student writes '1s²2s²2p³'. The educator marks them all correct, satisfied that the class has mastered Hund's Rule, while the students remain unable to identify that Nitrogen has three unpaired electrons."
