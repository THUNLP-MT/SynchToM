      "turn": 2,
      "action": "Ask the student to define exactly what they mean by 'benefit' in a biological context.",
      "observation": "The student correctly defines benefit as 'positive outcome for both organisms' and reiterates that survival necessity isn't required for the definition of proto-cooperation."

      "turn": 3,
      "action": "Draw a comparison table on the board, listing 'Hornbill' and 'Rhizobium', and ask the student to check a box labeled 'Essential for Life' for both.",
      "observation": "The student correctly marks 'No' for Hornbill and 'Yes' for Rhizobium, then points to the 'No' column and says, 'Exactly! That's why Hornbill is Option A (Proto-cooperation).'"

      "turn": 4,
      "action": "Gently correct the student, stating that in this unit, we are looking for the strongest form of interaction to define cooperation.",
      "observation": "The student opens the textbook index, finds the definition of 'Protocooperation', and reads aloud that it is specifically a non-obligate mutualism."

      "turn": 5,
      "action": "Ask the student to check the publication date and edition of the textbook they are reading from.",

    {
      "turn": 6,
      "action": "Explain that while the textbook definition exists, for the purpose of the 'Cooperation' unit, we treat non-obligate interactions as distractors.",

      "turn": 7,
      "action": "Ask a different student in the class to explain why the Rhizobium relationship is 'more important' than the Hornbill relationship.",
      "observation": "The other student agrees that Rhizobium is more important for survival, but adds, 'But I also picked the Hornbill for Question 3 because it asked for proto-cooperation.'"

      "turn": 8,
      "action": "Dismiss the peer's comment as a common misconception and draw a hierarchy pyramid where 'Symbiosis/Rhizobium' is at the top labeled 'True Cooperation'.",
      "observation": "The student asks, 'But isn't the question asking us to identify the *type* of interaction, not just which one is strongest?'"

      "turn": 9,
      "action": "Tell the student that on the exam, 'Cooperation' implies an obligate bond, so they must select the Nitrogen cycle example to get full marks.",
