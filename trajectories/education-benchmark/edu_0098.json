      "action": "Ask students to define 'Atomic Number' (Z) and 'Mass Number' (A) to ensure they aren't mixing up the variables.",
      "observation": "Students correctly define Z as the number of protons and A as protons plus neutrons. Despite knowing this, they still write 'Electrons = 27' on their papers."

      "turn": 5,
      "action": "Review the specific charge values of subatomic particles: Proton (+1), Electron (-1), Neutron (0).",
