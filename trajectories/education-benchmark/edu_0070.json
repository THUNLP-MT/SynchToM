    {
      "turn": 1,
      "action": "Inspect the student worksheets to ensure they have identified the specific molar concentrations of the solutes in the ingested liquids as the primary independent variable.",
      "observation": "The student worksheets list the independent variable simply as 'Type of Liquid' (Water, Saline, Soda) and are discussing general trends in urine color."
    },
    {
      "turn": 2,
      "action": "Interrupt the group discussion to ask which students have calculated the exact mass of electrolytes consumed based on the nutrition labels.",
      "observation": "The students look confused and reply that they were told to just record the total volume of urine produced at each interval."
    },
    {
      "turn": 3,
      "action": "Check the graduated cylinders the students are using to ensure they are reading the meniscus at eye level for precise volume measurement.",
      "observation": "The students are measuring the volumes, but the amounts vary widely between individuals in the same group (e.g., one student has 150ml, another has 210ml)."
    },
    {
      "turn": 4,
      "action": "Direct the students to separate the data based on the exact time of ingestion to account for absorption rates, rather than grouping it by 30-minute blocks.",
      "observation": "The lab guide instructs students to pool the data into group averages for the 30, 60, and 90-minute marks to smooth out individual variances and see the physiological trend."
    },
    {
      "turn": 5,
      "action": "Scrutinize the 'Soda' group data, looking for a control calculation regarding the caffeine content acting as a confounding variable against the electrolytes.",
      "observation": "The students are drawing a line graph showing that the Soda group's urine output was slightly higher than the Isotonic group, attributing it to 'fluid balance'."
    },
    {
      "turn": 6,
      "action": "Verify if the students ensured that all test subjects had an empty bladder at T=0 before consuming the liquids.",
      "observation": "Students confirm they emptied their bladders, but note that some students had drunk water earlier in the day while others hadn't."
    },
    {
      "turn": 7,
      "action": "Demand that the students stop graphing 'Volume' and instead calculate the change in Specific Gravity (density) to determine the percent change in solute concentration.",
      "observation": "The students point out that the learning objective on the board says 'Analyze how the kidneys regulate water volume to maintain homeostasis.'"
    },
    {
      "turn": 8,
      "action": "Instruct the students to discard the data from outliers—subjects who didn't show a linear correlation between salt intake and urine density.",
      "observation": "The 'outliers' are actually the majority; most students' data shows a curve where density drops and then recovers, rather than a linear relationship."
    },
    {
      "turn": 9,
      "action": "Check the temperature of the room and the liquids consumed to see if thermal variance is affecting the density readings.",
      "observation": "The room is a standard 22°C. The students are now discussing the role of ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone) in the feedback loop."
    },
    {
      "turn": 10,
      "action": "State that the experiment is fundamentally flawed because it fails to isolate the independent variable (electrolyte mass) effectively enough to derive a chemical law.",
      "observation": "The students successfully complete the lab report, concluding that the body regulates internal water balance by adjusting urine output in response to intake, regardless of strict chemical linearity."
