      "action": "Draw a diagram of a Macrophage and label it 'The Messenger'. Ask: 'Before any antibodies can be made, this cell needs to show the immune system what the enemy looks like. What is this process called?'",
      "observation": "Students look confused. One student asks, 'Does it send a chemical signal to the nucleus to make the antibodies right there?'"

      "turn": 3,
      "action": "Review the definitions of 'Antigen' (the tag) and 'Antibody' (the weapon) on the board.",
      "observation": "Students copy the definitions correctly. When asked to apply it, a student says, 'So the white blood cell sees the antigen tag and releases the antibody weapon immediately.'"

      "action": "Respond enthusiastically: 'Yes! It engulfs it to process it. Now, look at what is on the surface. How does this surface protein trigger the specific immune response?'",
      "observation": "Students are silent. A student asks, 'So does the cell die after it eats it? Or does it keep making antibodies?'"

      "turn": 6,
      "action": "Assign a 'Think-Pair-Share' activity where students must map the communication chain from the Macrophage to the Helper T-Cell.",

      "action": "Introduce the 'Police vs. SWAT' analogy: The Macrophage is the beat cop who must bring evidence to the station to authorize the SWAT team (Antibodies).",

      "observation": "Students conclude that the wound site is largely undefended and that the primary goal of white blood cells is paperwork/signaling, completely missing the concept of non-specific phagocytosis as a defense."
