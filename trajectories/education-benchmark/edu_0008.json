      "action": "I walk to the board and draw a water molecule with positive and negative dipoles. I ask, 'Does the liquid on top look like it wants to be near these charges?'",
      "observation": "Students look confused. One asks, 'Does the bottom liquid have more charges because it's thicker?'"

      "turn": 5,

      "turn": 6,
      "action": "I take the bottle back, add a few drops of water-based food coloring, and shake it again. I ask, 'Watch where the color goes. Why does it ignore the top layer?'",
      "observation": "The dye droplets sink rapidly through the oil layer without spreading, then mix into the water layer below. A student shouts, 'The drops are heavier than the oil!'"

      "action": "I ask the students to turn to their partners and discuss for two minutes: 'What chemical property does the dye share with the water?'",

      "action": "I bring up a real-world analogy: 'Think about salad dressing. Why do we have to shake oil and vinegar before pouring?'",
