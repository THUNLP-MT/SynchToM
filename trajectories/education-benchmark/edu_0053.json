      "turn": 2,
      "action": "Zoom in on the diagram to verify the atomic mass and atomic number of the Iron isotope shown.",
      "observation": "The diagram clearly labels the isotope as Fe-56 (Iron-56), located at the peak of the binding energy per nucleon curve."

      "turn": 3,
      "action": "Search the teacher's edition notes for 'Iron-56 transmutation equations'.",
      "observation": "The search results display a section titled 'Stellar Fusion Processes', detailing the Alpha ladder and the fusion of Silicon-28 into Nickel-56, which decays to Iron-56."

    {
      "turn": 4,
      "action": "Check the publication date and syllabus version of the digital textbook the students are accessing.",
      "observation": "The version is current. The Table of Contents lists 'Unit 1: Radioactivity' and 'Unit 2: Nuclear Energy (Fission and Fusion)' as separate chapters."

      "turn": 5,
      "action": "Open the 'Radioactivity' unit resources and attempt to tag the Iron-56 diagram with the keyword 'Transmutation'.",

    {
      "turn": 6,
      "action": "Perform a keyword search for 'Rutherford Transmutation' to compare it with the Iron diagram.",
      "observation": "The comparison highlights a distinction: Rutherford's experiment is labeled 'Artificial Transmutation' while the stellar process is labeled 'Thermonuclear Fusion'."

      "action": "Draft a sticky note on the shared screen: 'Note: In this class, we treat star processes as Natural Transmutation.'",

      "turn": 8,
      "action": "Look for a reaction pathway in the text that shows Iron-56 being produced specifically via Beta-plus decay from Nickel-56.",
      "observation": "The text confirms Nickel-56 decays to Iron-56, but explicitly contextualizes this as the 'aftermath of fusion processes' or 'explosive nucleosynthesis'."
