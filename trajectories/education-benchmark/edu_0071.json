      "action": "Asks the student to draw a diagram of the water before and after boiling on the whiteboard.",

      "turn": 3,
      "action": "Interprets the empty space in the drawing as 'infinite dispersal' and introduces the concept of an Open System.",
      "observation": "The student shakes their head and points to the empty space, stating, 'It's not an open system, it's just empty. The water turned into air, so it's not water anymore.'"

      "turn": 4,
      "action": "Corrects the terminology 'turned into air' by explaining that the molecules are the same, just in a higher entropy state, using a 'shuffled deck of cards' analogy.",
      "observation": "The student argues, 'But if I burn a card, it's gone. Boiling is like burning. You can't shuffle smoke back into a card.'"

      "turn": 6,
      "action": "Explains that the glass didn't 'save' the water, but rather limited the available 'Microstates', allowing the process to reverse.",
