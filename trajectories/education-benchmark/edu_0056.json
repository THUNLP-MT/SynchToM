      "turn": 1,
      "action": "Rearrange the classroom seating into groups of four and place a set of 'Unknown Compound' property cards on each desk.",
      "observation": "The students settle in. On the whiteboard, the previous teacher has left a large diagram of a Sodium atom transferring an electron to a Chlorine atom with the caption 'Key Concept'."
    },
    {
      "turn": 2,
      "action": "Erase the board and project the 'Physical Properties of Matter' spreadsheet, highlighting the column for Melting Points.",
      "observation": "Students open their notebooks. Several ask, 'Are we going to finish drawing the Lewis structures from yesterday? The study guide says we need to show the electron movement.'"
    },
    {
      "turn": 3,
      "action": "Dismiss the question about drawings and instruct the class to categorize the compounds in the spreadsheet solely based on whether they conduct electricity when dissolved.",
      "observation": "Students look at the data table. One student correctly identifies a compound as ionic but admits, 'I know it conducts, but I don't understand *why* the bond makes it do that.'"
    },
    {
      "turn": 4,
      "action": "Walk over to the window and close the blinds to improve the contrast of the projector screen displaying the data table.",
      "observation": "The room gets darker. A student raises their hand and asks if they can use the plastic molecular model kits sitting on the side shelf to visualize the atoms."
    },
    {
      "turn": 5,
      "action": "Ignore the model kits and instead write a large rule on the board: 'High MP + Conductivity = Ionic. Low MP + Non-conductive = Covalent.' Tell them to memorize this heuristic.",
      "observation": "Students copy the rule. When the teacher asks a check-for-understanding question about how the bond forms, a student reads the rule back verbatim rather than explaining electron transfer."
    },
    {
      "turn": 6,
      "action": "Check the time on the wall clock and announce they have 15 minutes left to finish the data analysis worksheet.",
      "observation": "The department head walks in for an informal observation, holding a rubric that specifically checks for 'Student ability to model valence electron interactions.'"
    },
    {
      "turn": 7,
      "action": "Loudly ask the class, 'Who can tell me the Boiling Point of Compound C?' and then ask, 'So, what kind of bond must it be?'",
      "observation": "A student answers 'Covalent because the boiling point is low.' The Department Head whispers to the user, 'Make sure they explain the electrostatic attraction or sharing mechanism, not just the result.'"
    },
    {
      "turn": 8,
      "action": "Nod at the Department Head but address the class: 'Exactly! The low boiling point tells us everything we need to know. The data never lies.'",
      "observation": "Students continue to fill out the table. A group is arguing about a compound with an intermediate melting point and looks for a way to draw the electrons to figure it out, but they lack the instructions to do so."
    },
    {
      "turn": 9,
      "action": "Circulate the room and check for pencil sharpness, offering a sharpener to students with dull pencils.",
      "observation": "Students sharpen pencils. One asks, 'On the test, if I get the bond right based on the melting point, do I still lose points if I draw the arrows wrong?'"
    },
    {
      "turn": 10,
      "action": "Hand out a second, more complex data table with 20 new compounds and assign it as homework, telling them to focus exclusively on the phase change temperatures.",
      "observation": "The bell rings. As students leave, they are heard complaining that they still don't know the difference between a cation and an anion, which is the first question on the upcoming unit test."
