      "observation": "The student reads the values correctly: Graphite is 0 kJ/mol and Diamond is +2.9 kJ/mol. The student says, 'See? It says diamond has higher energy and should turn into graphite. But look at this ring, it's not doing anything. The book's prediction is clearly false.'"

      "observation": "The student nods at the math. 'Okay, I get that the number is negative. That means it's spontaneous. But spontaneous means it happens naturally. This isn't happening. So the math doesn't match the real world.'"

Why does the book say it turns into graphite if it's sitting comfortably in that little hole?' (Student is alluding to the activation barrier/metastability)."
