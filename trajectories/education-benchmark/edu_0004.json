      "action": "I use a standard '1-2-3, eyes on me' call-and-response technique to ensure everyone is looking at the front of the room.",

      "action": "I shine a flashlight on the globe and spin it, asking, 'What is the Earth doing physically right now?'",

      "action": "I ask the class again, 'So, looking at the globe, why does the sun set?' expecting them to reference the spin.",

      "action": "I sigh and say, 'Forget about bed. Look at the spin.' I spin the globe faster. 'It sets because of Rotation. Say Rotation.'",

      "turn": 8,
      "action": "I ask for a thumbs-up/thumbs-down check: 'Show me a thumbs up if you know what the Earth is doing.'",
      "observation": "Most students give a thumbs up, but when called upon, a student says, 'The Earth is spinning so the owls can wake up.'"

      "turn": 9,
      "action": "I walk over to the 'Nocturnal Animals' poster on the side wall and stand in front of it, blocking their view, while pointing back to the globe.",
      "observation": "The students look disappointed. The connection they were making between the cycle and the animals is severed, leaving them confused about the relevance of the spinning globe."

    {
      "turn": 10,
      "action": "I hand out a worksheet that only has diagrams of spheres and arrows, with no pictures of animals or people, and tell them to draw the axis.",
      "observation": "The students start the worksheet. Many of them draw smiley faces on the sun and sleeping caps on the Earth, continuing to try to bridge the gap I am refusing to acknowledge."
