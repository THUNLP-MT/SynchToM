      "observation": "Only two team members submit the form. One submission is blank, and the other contains a vague, passive-aggressive comment about 'waste of time'."

      "action": "Create a meeting agenda with a strict '5-minute per topic' timer displayed on the shared screen.",
      "observation": "During the first topic, two developers start arguing about a code review from three weeks ago. They ignore the timer completely, talking over it even after it beeps."

      "turn": 3,
      "action": "Research and download a 'Retrospective Template' based on Agile best practices.",
      "observation": "When presented with the template, the team remains silent. One member keeps their camera off and audibly sighs when asked to fill in the 'What went well' column."

      "action": "implement a 'digital talking stick' rule where microphones are hard-muted unless it is that specific person's scheduled turn to speak.",
      "observation": "When it is their turn to speak, team members say 'I pass' or 'Nothing to add.' The chat box, however, is active with sarcastic comments about being in 'kindergarten'."

      "turn": 6,
      "action": "Break the single retrospective meeting into three separate, smaller meetings based on job function (Design, Dev, QA).",
      "observation": "In the 'Dev' breakout, the developers refuse to talk about the project issues, citing that the problems stem from the Design team (who are not present)."
