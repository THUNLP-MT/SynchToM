      "observation": "The team arrives at the meeting. The lead developer mentions that they tried the code examples on page 14, but the API returned a 404 Not Found error."
    },

      "turn": 2,
      "action": "Check the team's firewall settings and API access tokens during the start of the call.",
      "observation": "Network connectivity is stable and tokens are valid. The developer shares their screen, showing the request URL matches the documentation exactly, yet the error persists."

      "turn": 3,
      "action": "Create a simplified 'Cheat Sheet' slide that breaks down the dense paragraphs from page 14 into bullet points.",
      "observation": "The developers implement the code using the bullet points (which mirror the errors in the docs). The API responds with 'Invalid Parameter: client_secret'. A developer notes that a forum post suggests this parameter was renamed in the latest version."

      "action": "Draw a flowchart on the whiteboard that visualizes the logic described in the documentation text.",
      "observation": "The flowchart perfectly matches the documentation. However, when the team executes the step 'Wait for Callback', the API never sends a callback. The senior dev checks the header and sees 'X-API-Version: v2.0'."
