    {
      "turn": 1,
      "action": "Request the design team to render 5 new static perspective slides specifically focusing on the atrium connection points.",
      "observation": "The client reviews the new slides but comments that while the images look crisp, they still can't get a 'feel' for the vertical distance between the catwalk and the machinery below."
    },
    {
      "turn": 2,
      "action": "Audit the render settings to ensure lighting exposure and contrast are set to maximum clarity.",
      "observation": "The lighting is adjusted to be perfectly even. The client remarks that the images look very flat and clinical, making it even harder to judge distances."
    },
    {
      "turn": 3,
      "action": "Overlay explicit bright red dimension lines and 'flow arrows' on all 2D perspective slides.",
      "observation": "The client finds the slides cluttered with lines. They ask, 'Is there a way we can just stand on that balcony and look down?'"
    },
    {
      "turn": 4,
      "action": "Instruct the team to re-skin the floor levels with distinct, high-contrast color palettes (Blue for Level 1, Orange for Level 2).",
      "observation": "The client agrees the colors help identify zones, but reiterates that they are worried about the 'tightness' of the space which they can't gauge from a picture."
    },
    {
      "turn": 5,
      "action": "Order the generation of ultra-high-resolution 8K renders and crop in on specific 'detail zones' to create a 50-slide deck.",
      "observation": "The client scrolls through the massive deck on a monitor. They look frustrated and mention that their competitor used a headset to show them a similar facility last week."
    },
    {
      "turn": 6,
      "action": "Dismiss the headset comment as 'unreliable tech' and instead commission a wide-format panoramic stitched image (2D) to be printed.",
      "observation": "The panoramic image distorts the straight lines of the architecture. The client says, 'It looks warped. I need to know what it feels like to walk through, not look at a fish-eye photo.'"
    },
    {
      "turn": 7,
      "action": "Pull up the presentation archive from the 2018 logistics project to compare the slide layouts.",
      "observation": "The 2018 project was a single-story rectangular warehouse with no vertical complexity. The comparison highlights how inadequate slides are for the current multi-level project."
    },
    {
      "turn": 8,
      "action": "Generate a series of 20 sequential 'cross-section' slice images taken at 1-meter intervals through the building.",
      "observation": "The client is completely confused by the abstract slice images and cannot mentally reconstruct them into a 3D space."
    },
    {
      "turn": 9,
      "action": "Create a pre-rendered, non-interactive MP4 fly-through video that follows a rigid, slow path through the facility.",
      "observation": "The client watches the video and asks to stop and look to the left at a specific junction. They are annoyed when told they can't change the camera angle because it's a pre-made video."
    },
    {
      "turn": 10,
      "action": "Print all 50 high-res perspective renders on A0 poster boards and tape them physically around the conference room walls.",
      "observation": "The client stands in the center of the room surrounded by posters, looking disappointed. They state, 'I still can't tell if the forklift fits under the mezzanine. We need to model this in VR.'"
