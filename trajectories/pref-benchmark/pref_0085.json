      "observation": "The recording shows the slide was on screen for 5 minutes. The stakeholders are seen leaning in close to their monitors and squinting."

      "turn": 2,
      "action": "Draft a new script adding explicit cues like 'Please listen closely to this part' and 'Let me tell you the story of Q3'.",
      "observation": "A colleague reviews the plan and says, 'The script is fine, but are you keeping that visual? It's really dense.'"

      "turn": 3,
      "action": "Check the microphone settings and research better audio compression software.",
      "observation": "The audio test comes back crystal clear. The slide on the screen remains a blur of 8pt font and overlapping jagged lines."

      "turn": 4,
      "action": "Practice the presentation again, focusing on slowing down my cadence by 20%.",
      "observation": "During the practice run, the screen is shared. The text 'Project Launch' is pixelated and unreadable against the dark background."

      "action": "Reply to the email: 'I will explain the dates in detail during the call to ensure you understand the context behind them.'",

      "action": "Check internet bandwidth and screen-sharing optimization settings for 'video/motion' rather than 'static content'.",
      "observation": "Settings are changed to 'optimize for video'. The static slide now looks even fuzzier due to compression artifacts."
