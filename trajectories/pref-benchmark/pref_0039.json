      "action": "Send a survey to the engineering team asking: 'Did you feel the recent workshops provided enough accountability for your learning goals?'",
      "observation": "Only 15% of the team responds. The few responses received are short: 'Too busy to attend,' 'Workshops are fine but we have too many tickets,' and 'Need dedicated time to fix technical debt, not more meetings.'"

      "observation": "The architect replies with frustration: 'We don't need training on how to code; we need time to pay down the debt. Please do not add more mandatory hours to our schedule.'"
