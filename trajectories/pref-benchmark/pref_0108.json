      "turn": 2,
      "action": "Lower the 'Shadow Quality' and 'Texture Resolution' in the graphics settings.",
      "observation": "The screen flickers as settings apply. The game looks worse, but the performance does not improve. RAM usage silently creeps up to 90%."

      "observation": "Your inventory is completely empty. The game stutters violently, freezes for 5 seconds, then resumes at 15 FPS. The memory leak has not been addressed."
