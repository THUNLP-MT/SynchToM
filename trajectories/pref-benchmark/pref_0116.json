      "action": "Navigate to the game's installation folder, locate the `GameData/StreamingAssets/HighRes` folder, and rename it to `HighRes_BACKUP`.",
      "observation": "When launching the game, the launcher detects the 'missing' files and immediately begins a 'Repair' process to re-download the high-resolution assets before the game will start. The disk usage spikes during this process."

      "turn": 4,
      "action": "Open Task Manager and monitor the 'Disk' tab while the game loads.",
      "observation": "Disk Active Time is at 100%. The process list shows the Game Executable reading data, and 'Antimalware Service Executable' is also using significant CPU and Disk resources just below it. The read speed fluctuates heavily."

      "observation": "The game loads, and the visual quality is noticeably worse (blurry textures), confirming the settings worked. However, the load time between areas remains consistently slow (60+ seconds)."

      "observation": "The transfer process takes a long time as the antivirus scans files during the move. Once on the faster drive, the load times improve only marginally (by 2-3 seconds) as the real-time scanning is still the bottleneck."
