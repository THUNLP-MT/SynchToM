    {
      "turn": 2,
      "action": "Increase the printing bed temperature from 60°C to 65°C.",
      "observation": "The printer heats up. The nozzle moves across the bed. On the right side, the filament doesn't touch the plate at all; on the left, it adheres slightly. The print fails due to detachment."

      "action": "Disable the part cooling fan for the first 5 layers.",
      "observation": "The plastic stays molten longer, but because the nozzle distance varies across the bed, the molten plastic just curls up around the nozzle in the low spots."

      "observation": "The raft prints unevenly—transparently thin on one side, non-existent on the other. The intense heat causes the edges of the raft to curl up (warp) and detach."
