    {
      "turn": 1,
      "action": "Draft a role-playing script titled 'The Coffee Shop Dilemma' where students act as owners deciding whether to raise latte prices.",
      "observation": "Students seem interested in the story and participate in the debate about raising prices. However, when asked to calculate the specific coefficient based on the demand curve provided in the scenario, the majority leave the answer blank or guess random numbers."
    },
    {
      "turn": 2,
      "action": "Survey the class about the pacing of the lecture and if they found the 'Coffee Shop' story relatable.",
      "observation": "Students respond that the story was fun and easy to follow. Several comments mention they are 'confused about the math part' or 'don't remember how to do the slope thing'."
    },
    {
      "turn": 3,
      "action": "Simplify the slides by removing the 'Point Elasticity' formula and replacing it with visual diagrams of rubber bands stretching.",
      "observation": "Students nod along with the rubber band analogy. When given a practice problem to find elasticity at P=5 for Q=50-2P^2, they stare blankly at the paper."
    },
    {
      "turn": 4,
      "action": "Search online for 'gamified economics activities' to replace the standard lecture entirely.",
      "observation": "Found several games. Most reviews for the advanced games note that they require a strong calculus background to play effectively."
    },
    {
      "turn": 5,
      "action": "Create a 'Price War' team competition where groups win points for predicting revenue changes, explicitly telling them to 'trust their gut' rather than using calculators.",
      "observation": "The game is lively and loud. However, when the game requires them to determine the exact price point where revenue is maximized (requiring a derivative), every team answers incorrectly."
    },
    {
      "turn": 6,
      "action": "Invite a colleague from the Humanities department to observe the class and give feedback on student engagement.",
      "observation": "The colleague reports that the students seem highly engaged with the role-play but appear visibly anxious and lost whenever a graph or function is displayed on the board."
    },
    {
      "turn": 7,
      "action": "Rewrite the upcoming quiz to be entirely word-problem based, embedding the numbers in a paragraph about a music festival ticket sale.",
      "observation": "Quiz scores are the lowest yet. Students highlight the demand function in the text but write notes in the margins like 'How do I derive this?' and 'Is this the power rule?'"
    },
    {
      "turn": 8,
      "action": "Dedicate a full session to acting out the 'Music Festival' scenario with props and costumes, refusing to write any numbers on the board.",
      "observation": "Students have fun with the costumes. A student raises their hand and asks, 'Professor, I understand the concept, but I don't know how to get the coefficient from the curve equation on the homework.'"
    },
    {
      "turn": 9,
      "action": "Dismiss the student's question as 'getting bogged down in semantics' and pivot the discussion back to the psychology of consumer choice.",
      "observation": "The class looks relieved to stop talking about math. However, the subsequent departmental assessment shows a 90% failure rate on the section requiring calculus-based elasticity calculations."
    },
    {
      "turn": 10,
      "action": "Draft a formal complaint to the curriculum board arguing that the Price Elasticity module is 'pedagogically unsound' and 'lacks soul.'",
      "observation": "The curriculum board responds, pointing out that the course has a prerequisite of Calculus I which most of the failing students have not yet completed."
