      "turn": 2,
      "action": "Edit the video description and thumbnail to explicitly feature a diverse, non-traditional family structure image.",

      "action": "Rewrite the script to swap the gender roles entirely (Mother goes to work, Father cooks) and reshoot the intro scene.",
      "observation": "After uploading the new version, the system flags a 'Encoding Error' warning for mobile optimization, but the desktop version plays fine. Retention remains near zero for mobile users."

      "turn": 5,
      "action": "Send a survey to the students asking: 'Did you feel the family representation in the case study was exclusionary?'",
      "observation": "Survey results come back. 80% of respondents skipped the question. Of the comments received, most say 'I couldn't watch it to judge' or 'It just loads a black screen'."

      "turn": 6,
      "action": "Add a 'Trigger Warning' and an explanatory text preamble about historical context before the video starts.",
      "observation": "Analytics show students are spending time reading the preamble, but the video drop-off rate is still 95% at the 0:00-0:05 mark."
