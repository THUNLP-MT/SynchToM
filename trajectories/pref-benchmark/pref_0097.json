      "observation": "Drivers update successfully. Upon relaunching the game, the splash screen logos are crisp, but as soon as the main menu loads, everything becomes blurry and blocky again."

      "action": "Search NexusMods for 'HD Model Replacements' and 'Realistic Character Overhaul'.",

      "observation": "The mod installs. The surfaces of the character's jacket now have detailed noise, but the jacket itself is still rendered as a jagged, blocky shape. The edges look like a saw blade."
