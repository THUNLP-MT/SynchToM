      "turn": 2,
      "action": "Request the official job descriptions and departmental bylaws from HR.",
      "observation": "HR provides the documents, which contain complex lists of dual-responsibilities and a note suggesting that 'reporting lines are best understood contextually.'"

      "action": "Expand the document to 6 pages, adding a 'Scenario Analysis' section that describes specific reporting instances in paragraph form.",

      "turn": 6,
      "action": "Send the draft to the Technical Writing team for a grammar and syntax audit.",
      "observation": "The Technical Writing team returns the draft with minor edits but strongly suggests adding a visual aid, noting that the matrix structure is 'cognitively overloading' in text form."
