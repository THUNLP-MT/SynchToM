    {
      "turn": 1,
      "action": "Announce a mandatory 'Gamified Hackathon' for the weekend, requiring the team to produce a working prototype by Sunday evening.",
      "observation": "The team receives the announcement with visible anxiety. Several members ask if they can spend the weekend reading the protocol whitepaper and studying the mathematical proofs instead of coding."
    },
    {
      "turn": 2,
      "action": "Set up a dedicated Git repository with a CI/CD pipeline that runs automated tests on every commit.",
      "observation": "The infrastructure is ready. A junior developer messages: 'The tests keep failing because I don't understand how the zero-knowledge proof assertion is derived. Is there a formula guide?'"
    },
    {
      "turn": 3,
      "action": "Reply to the developer: 'Don't worry about the derivation, just look at the interface definitions and implement the function signatures. Trial and error is your friend here.'",
      "observation": "The developer commits code that matches the interface but uses standard arithmetic instead of modular arithmetic, causing immediate validation errors."
    },
    {
      "turn": 4,
      "action": "Create a 'Leaderboard' dashboard that tracks number of commits and lines of code written, with a gift card for the winner.",
      "observation": "Commit volume increases, but the code is full of copy-pasted logic from StackOverflow that doesn't apply to this specific cryptographic curve. The error logs show fundamental logic failures."
    },
    {
      "turn": 5,
      "action": "Install a specialized IDE plugin that highlights syntax errors and offers autocomplete for the specific language we are using.",
      "observation": "The team uses the plugin, so syntax errors disappear. However, the runtime errors persist because the algorithms implemented are mathematically unsound."
    },
    {
      "turn": 6,
      "action": "Schedule a 'Live Coding' session where I watch their screens and tell them to 'just try changing the parameters' when they hit a bug.",
      "observation": "The developers randomly change variables as instructed, but they look confused. One asks, 'But if we change the prime modulus, doesn't that break the security assumption? I don't get why we're doing this.'"
    },
    {
      "turn": 7,
      "action": "Order premium pizza and coffee for the team to keep energy levels high during the coding session.",
      "observation": "The team eats, but during the break, they are huddled together sketching diagrams on napkins, trying to figure out the algebraic relationship between the keys."
    },
    {
      "turn": 8,
      "action": "Interrupt their discussion and say: 'Stop drawing pictures! The truth is in the code. Get back to the sandbox and run the test suite again.'",
      "observation": "The team reluctantly goes back to keyboards. They stare at the screen. One junior dev admits, 'I can type it, but I don't know what to type because I don't understand what a homomorphic property is.'"
    },
    {
      "turn": 9,
      "action": "Create a simplified 'sandbox' environment that mocks the network layer, thinking the network complexity is distracting them from coding.",
      "observation": "The network errors vanish, but the cryptographic verification fails 100% of the time. The team is now randomly guessing values to satisfy the tests."
    },
    {
      "turn": 10,
      "action": "Extend the hackathon by 12 hours and announce a 'Brute Force' bonus for the team member who runs the most test iterations.",
      "observation": "The team is exhausted and demoralized. They have produced thousands of lines of code, none of which implement the protocol correctly because the underlying mathematical logic is missing."
