      "turn": 3,
      "action": "Explicitly pass the `obstime` argument into the `transform_to()` method call, rather than relying on the coordinate's internal attribute.",

      "observation": "The coordinates in GCRS are NOT stable; they show the same drift pattern. (System Note: This is because transformation to GCRS adds stellar aberration/parallax relative to the SSB, which is the root cause, but the user interprets this as rotation error)."

      "observation": "The plot shows a periodic drift, but the period matches the Earth's annual orbital period (aberration cycle), not just the daily rotation. (System Note: User interprets this as a 'time scale scaling error' rather than aberration)."
